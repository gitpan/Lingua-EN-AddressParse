Lingua::EN::AddressParse - routines for manipulating geographical addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Lingua::EN::AddressParse;

   my %args =
   (
      country     => 'Australia',
      auto_clean  => 1,
      force_case  => 1
   );

   my $address = new Lingua::EN::AddressParse(%args);

   $error = $address->parse("14A MAIN RD. ST JOHNS WOOD NEW SOUTH WALES 2000");

   %my_address = $address->components;
   $suburb = $my_address{suuburb};

   $correct_casing = $address->case_all;


=head1 DESCRIPTION


This module takes as input an address or post box in free format text
such as,

    12/3-5 AUBREY ST VERMONT VIC 3133
    "OLD REGRET" WENTWORTH FALLS NSW 2782 AUSTRALIA
    2A OLD SOUTH LOW ST. KEW NEW SOUTH WALES 2123
    GPO Box K318, HAYMARKET, NSW 2000


and attempts to parse it. If successful, the address is broken
down into components and useful functions can be performed such as :

   converting upper or lower case values to name case (2 Low St. Kew NSW 2123 )
   extracting the addresses individual components     (2,Low St.,KEW,NSW,2123 )
   determining the type of format the address is in   ('suburban')


If the address cannot be parsed you have the option of cleaning the address
of bad characters, or extracting any portion that was parsed and the
portion that failed.

This module can be used for analysing and improving the quality of
lists of addresses.
