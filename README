=head1 NAME

Lingua::EN::AddressParse - routines for manipulating geographical addresses

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Lingua::EN::AddressParse;

   my %args = 
   (
      auto_clean  => 1,
      force_case  => 1
   );

   my $address = new Lingua::EN::AddressParse(%args); 

   $error = $address->parse("14A MAIN RD. ST JOHNS WOOD NSW 2000");

   %my_address = $address->components;
   $suburb = $my_address{suuburb};

   $correct_casing = $address->case_all;


=head1 DESCRIPTION


This module takes as input a person or persons address in 
free format text such as,

	12/3-5 AUBREY ST VERMONT VIC 3133
	"OLD REGRET" WENTWORTH FALLS NSW 2782 AUSTRALIA
	2A Low ST. KEW NSW 2123

and attempts to parse it. If successful, the address is broken
down into components and useful functions can be performed such as :

   converting upper or lower case values to name case (2 Low St. Kew NSW 2123 )
   extracting the addresses individual components     (2,Low St.,KEW,NSW,2123 )
   determining the type of format the address is in   ('suburban')


If the address cannot be parsed you have the option of cleaning the address
of bad characters, or extracting any portion that was parsed and the 
portion that failed.

This module can be used for analysing and improving the quality of
lists of addresses.
