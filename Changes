Revision history for Perl CPAN module Lingua::EN::AddressParse

1.14 18 Jul 2005
    Fixed auto_clean option so that quotes are retained, needed for rural property names
    Added report method to dump address properties and components
    Updated distribution to current CPAN requirements 


1.13 22 Jun 2005

    Added US style sub properties, such as 123 Main St Suite # 12 Somewhere CA 92345 
    Added US style street directional suffix, such as 123 Main St S Somewhere CA 92345 

    Added new address type 'road_box'. This allows for box identifier such as RMB, 
    optionally street name and type, then suburb and post code.

    Sub property values are now returned as as separate component sub_property_identifier, 
      not as part of the property_identifier component

    Created a better grammar for property_identifier
    Removed incorrect validity tests that were not accounting for ordinal street types
    Fixed auto_clean option so that numbers are retained in ordinal street types!
    Expanded and improved documentation and comments


1.12 07 Mar 2004
    Removed any sub country descriptive text (in square brackets) that occurs from grammar.

1.11 21 Mar 2002
    Let user specify country argument to 'new' method as either country 
    code (AU) or full name (AUSTRALIA). Changed documentation to reflect 
    this, altered United Kingdom code from 'UK' (incorrect) to 'GB'

    Allowed for forced abbreviations of sub country
